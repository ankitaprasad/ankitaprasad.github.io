I am a software developer who has been working in the industry for the last 10 years. 

I have helped build software for kids like [LEGO WeDo][Wedo] as well as software for scientist and engineers like [LabVIEW Comminications System Design Suite][LVCSDS].

I mostly code in C# at work. 

This blog is my digital footprint outside of work. The plan is to write about software and hardware side projects mixed with my thoughts on women and technology.
